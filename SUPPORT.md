# Support for GradleUp projects

Any bug reports, feature requests and comments are welcome!
The project keeps evolving,
and any feedback from end users and developers will be appreciated.
At the moment, there is no public Slack channel,

## Raising Issues and Feature Requests

Use GitHub Issues.
Note that it may take some time to get a response, thanks for your patience.
Contributions are always welcome, see the Contributor Guidelines.

## Reporting Security Issues

Please do NOT use public GitHub Issues for reporting vulnerabilities.
You can submit any security issue or suspected vulnerability on GitHub Security pages,
which are available in project repositories.
Read More - [Security Policy](./SECURITY.md).

## Setting Expectations

GradleUp is a community driven project,
most of contributors and maintainers invest their personal time.
We do not guarantee a response or resolution
time for the submitted issues.

## Commercial Support and Customization

The GradleUp projects prioritize the community support with a best effort,

Do not hesitate reaching out to them.

**Protip:** Supporting the work of maintainers and contributors on GitHub Sponsors and other platforms is always appreciated.
