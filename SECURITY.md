# Security Policy

## Reporting Security Issues

You can submit any security issue or suspected vulnerability
on the GitHub Security pages of the project.
Please do **NOT** use public GitHub Issues for reporting vulnerabilities.

## Bug Bounty

Unless documented explicitly,
GradleUp projects are not a part of
any security bug bounty program and,
as of now, of any other program.

For confirmed issues, we will be happy to credit you in the public Security Advisory and on social media.
